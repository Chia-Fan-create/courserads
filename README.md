# Coursera Data Science Coursework and Projects

This repository documents my learning notes, lab exercises, and final projects completed on the Coursera platform, focusing on various data science domains. The core content covers Python programming, data analysis, SQL database operations, and web scraping techniques.

### Project Structure

This repository is organized into directories corresponding to different courses or modules, providing clear access to the learning materials:

| Directory/File | Content Description | Related Skills |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Data Analysis with Python/` | **Course Labs and Data Cleaning:** Contains various `.csv` files (`auto.csv`, `laptops.csv`, etc.) and Jupyter notebooks focused on data wrangling, cleaning, loading, and initial analysis. | Pandas, Data Loading, Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling |
| `Data Science with SQL/` | **SQL Practice:** Dedicated folder for exercises and notes related to SQL queries and database interaction. (The previous structure's `SQL/` content might now be here). | SQL, Database Queries |
| `DB/` | **Database Fundamentals:** Content potentially covering database theory, design, and fundamental concepts. | Database Theory, Data Modeling |
| `python project for data science/` | **Integrated Projects:** Contains notebooks that combine Python, SQL, and data science concepts, including: `accessing-DB-with-SQL-magic.ipynb`, `analyzing-dataset-with-SQL-Python.ipynb`, and the `mod5_final_project.ipynb`. | Python, SQL Integration, Project Application |
| `.venv/` | **Virtual Environment:** Contains the isolated Python environment and package dependencies for the project. | Virtual Environments, Dependency Management |
| `.gitignore` | Defines files and directories to be ignored by Git (e.g., environment files, cached data). | Git |
| `README.md` | Provides an overview, structure, and instructions for this repository. | Documentation |

    8.  **Data Visualization with Python** (Course 8)
    9.  **Machine Learning with Python** (Course 9)
    10. **Applied Data Science Capstone** (Course 10)
    11. **Generative AI: Elevate Your Data Science Career** (Course 11)
    12. **Data Scientist Career Guide and Interview Preparation** (Course 12)

### How to View or Run the Notebooks

1.  **Clone the repository:**

        git clone https://github.com/Chia-Fan-create/courserads.git

2.  **Install Dependencies:** \
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment (`venv`) to install the required libraries.
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
    # For web scraping
    pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
    ```
3.  **Run Jupyter Notebook:**
    Start the Jupyter service from the root project directory to view or run the `.ipynb` files.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
